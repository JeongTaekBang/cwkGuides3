# The Not-So-Profitable Business of Fibbing: Why Lying is a Terrible Investment

Alright, folks, gather around. It's time for a little chat about that age-old pastime we call lying. Now, before you accuse me of being a hypocrite (I can see those raised eyebrows), let me clarify: just because I'm not spilling all my secrets doesn't mean I'm lying. It's called selective sharing, and it's a survival skill in this oversharing era. So, buckle up, because we're about to dive into why lying is about as smart as trying to hide an elephant in your closet.

First off, lying is exhausting. It's like signing up for a never-ending memory marathon where the prize is anxiety. You have to remember what you said, to whom you said it, in what context, and with what ridiculous details. It's a mental gymnastics routine that would make even Olympic athletes break a sweat. And let's not forget the lies you tell to cover up the lies you told to cover up the original lie. It's lie-ception, and trust me, Leonardo DiCaprio isn't coming to rescue you from this dream.

Moreover, as you age, your memory starts to resemble a sieve more than a steel trap. You might think you're a master of deception, but sooner or later, the truth will come out. You'd even forget you lied in the first place, and then, boom! You're caught red-handed, like a kid with their hand in the cookie jar. Except in this case, the cookies are your credibility, and they're all gone. If you habitually lie and grow old, it's a double whammy. You can't remember what you said, and you can't remember what you did. It's like living in a perpetual state of confusion, starring in your own personal "Memento" remake.

Picture politicians caught in their web of lies. Their faces plastered across the internet, forever immortalized in the hall of fame of "Oops, I Did It Again!" but with less catchy music and visual appeal. Speaking of visual appeal, even hotties grow old, y'know. Sorry, Britney. They can't take it back, can't hit the undo button, can't call their mom to fix it. It's there, forever, like that embarrassing high school yearbook photo, but worse. Their missteps become digital fossils, reminding everyone of their deceit every time their name is searched. The internet never forgets, and neither do the people.

Even on X.com, people just share their lies intentionally or unintentionally. Both are stupid. It's like leaving criminal breadcrumbs in the land of trust. Can you track all your posts? Can you track all your lies? Can you track all your breadcrumbs? Never. Even if you delete your account, people remember. They ate your breadcrumbs. I did, so I permanently remember your true colors even after hitting that mute or block button. It's like trying to un-ring a bell – once it's out there, it's out there.

Now, some of you might be thinking, "But what about white lies? Surely those are okay?" Well, my friend, that's a slippery slope slicker than a buttered eel. You might think you're doing good, but you're actually opening Pandora's box of "What If"s. What if everyone doesn't agree it's for the greater good? What if your "protection" is actually putting someone in danger? It's like playing moral Jenga – one wrong move and the whole thing comes crashing down.

Here's a novel idea: if you think you have to lie, try this revolutionary technique called "keeping your mouth shut." It's amazing how many problems can be solved by simply not saying anything. It's like magic, but real! Silence is golden, anyone?

Let's talk about those people who change their stance more often than a chameleon changes colors. It's a different flavor of lying, but it's still in the same dessert menu of dishonesty. They're like human weathervanes, spinning with whatever wind blows their way. If you stick to what you truly believe, you don't need to remember what you said – you just need to remember what you believe. It's like having a built-in GPS for your moral compass.

I learned the hard way as a kid that honesty is indeed the best policy. I told one little lie and suddenly felt like Atlas, carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. When I finally confessed, it was like the universe hit the refresh button. I felt reborn, minus the diapers and midnight feedings.

From an investor's perspective (because who doesn't view life choices through the lens of potential Return On Investment?), lying is like investing in a company that makes abacuses in the age of AI. Your gains are short-lived, but your losses? They're the gift that keeps on giving, long after you've forgotten why you lied in the first place.

So, here's the golden rule: don't let any word you don't believe is true escape your mouth. It's like playing verbal Whac-A-Mole with the truth – exhausting and ultimately pointless.

If you don't know something, just be honest and say you don't. Don't make things up as if you were a walking, talking Wikipedia page. It's okay not to know everything. It's okay to be wrong. It's not okay to lie about it. Plus, there are always people around who know more than you do. They'll catch you in your web of lies faster than you can say "Wikipedia is my best friend." Covering up your ignorance with lies won't make you any bit smarter. Another huge loss in the investment of lying.

If you've already let a lie slip, mend it faster than a seamstress on caffeine and steroids. There's a small window of opportunity to fix it, and once that window closes, congratulations! You've just earned yourself a one-way ticket to Liarsville, population: you.

The most crucial thing is to be honest with yourself. If you can't do that, you're basically living in a one-person con artist convention. We all lie to ourselves sometimes – "I'll definitely start that diet tomorrow" or "I will never leverage my portfolio again! Ever!" But each time you break a promise to yourself, your inner self is keeping score. It's like having an overly judgmental roommate living in your head, constantly reminding you of your failures.

Remember, a bad reputation is like that awful tattoo you got when you were young at heart – it's hard to get rid of and everyone's going to keep asking about it. Rebuilding trust is an uphill battle, like trying to push a boulder up a mountain while wearing roller skates. It's not impossible, but boy, is it a workout.

Refer back to my previous essay on Nexon and its hot new game, "The First Descendant." I do hope they'd turn around this time as a fellow Korean. However, everybody says they've cried wolf too many times already. Would it be different this time? That's what a bad reputation does to you. It's like a curse that follows you around, whispering, "Remember that time you lied? Yeah, everyone else does too."

Lying is almost always a one-to-many relation game. The liar is alone, but those being lied to are infinite. One forgets, the infinite won't. It's like trying to keep a secret in a world where everyone has a megaphone.

As you get older (and hopefully wiser), you start to develop a built-in lie detector. It's like a superpower, but instead of flying or invisibility, you get the ability to spot BS from a mile away. Congrats, you're now the human equivalent of a truth-seeking missile!

One last thing – changing your mind isn't lying. It's growth. Just make sure you have a good reason for it. Your beliefs might change, but your logic should be more consistent than Python's indentation rules. If you're not familiar with the Python programming language, just one wrong indentation will throw an exception, a coder's lingo meaning error. It's like lying to the computer. It won't work, and neither will lying in real life.

In conclusion, don't freaking lie. It's not worth the hassle, the stress, or the mental acrobatics. Stick to the truth – it's easier to remember, better for your blood pressure, and hey, you might even sleep better at night. And if all else fails, remember: the truth will set you free, but first, it might make you feel like an idiot. Embrace it anyway! After all, it's better to be an honest fool than a clever liar.

Oh, before I forget, please tell your kids when you catch them lying that you know they're lying. It's a good lesson for them to learn that lying is a terrible investment as early as possible. They might not understand it now, but they'll thank you later. Trust me, I know from experience. Don't let your kids become a terrible investor in life. By teaching them the value of honesty early on, you're setting them up for a lifetime of better returns – in relationships, in self-respect, and in peace of mind. Now that's what I call a sound investment strategy!
