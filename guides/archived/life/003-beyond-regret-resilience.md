# From Regret to Resilience: Trusting Your True North

![](images/003-1.png)

It's human nature to look back and think about all the things we should have done, could have done, would have done. This bias gets reinforced when we see others achieve what we think we could have achieved, or even when we see successes we believe were out of our reach.

Nothing good comes from dwelling on the past. When it comes to executing sound principles and strategies, any outcome you label as "should have," "could have," or "would have" is just one possibility among infinite others. By using these phrases, you falsely assume that similar future situations must yield the same results.

Even an undesired outcome is merely one possibility among countless others. You can't change what happened, nor can you predict future outcomes with certainty - even when circumstances seem identical. The variables at play are too numerous and complex to guarantee any specific result.

So what can you rely on? Your principles and strategies remain your true north. They are your map through the unknown, your compass in uncharted waters, and your rudder through unpredictable storms.

The only guarantee you can give yourself is: "I did the best I could with what I had at the time." In similar future situations, this mindset - not wishful thinking about different outcomes - should guide you.

When you feel this bias creeping in, consider rolling a die. We live in a world of infinite possibilities, where probability rules. Even seemingly certain outcomes aren't 100% guaranteed - not even your existence tomorrow. The universe operates on probability at its most fundamental level, where even the smallest particles exist in multiple potential states.

While principles should remain steadfast, strategies can and should evolve. When an outcome provides meaningful insights, use them to refine your strategies - but never compromise your core principles to justify results. If an outcome offers no strategic lessons, treat it as statistical noise and maintain your course. Your original principles were sound.

Consider legendary investors who sometimes appear to contradict their past market positions. When a legend holds cash despite preaching long-term investment, or when another legend shifts allocation despite advocating balance, they aren't abandoning their principles - they're expressing them in different market conditions. Their core principles remain unchanged; only their tactical decisions adapt to the environment.

Never abandon your principles when the going gets tough. Like a compass that always points north regardless of the weather, your principles should guide you through both calm and stormy seas.

When a strategy's outcome differs significantly from expectations, resist the urge to immediately change course. Instead, return to your foundational principles and original strategy. Analyze them with fresh eyes - were they truly sound and well-reasoned? If not, the issue lies deeper than tactical adjustments. Rather than dwelling on what "should have" been done differently, focus on rebuilding from a stronger foundation.

Ask yourself honestly: Were your initial principles carefully considered and your strategies methodically planned? Or did you act primarily on impulse, external pressure, or simply get lucky? This self-reflection requires brutal honesty, as you alone can truly evaluate your decision-making process.

Consider this: Frequently finding yourself thinking in terms of "should have," "could have," or "would have" often indicates your principles and strategies weren't as solid as they needed to be. When this happens, don't just adjust tactics - return to first principles and rebuild your approach from the ground up.

A rational person would never say "I should have pulled that slot machine" when watching someone else win the jackpot. The outcome was purely chance - no strategy or principle could have predicted or influenced it. This illustrates perfectly why "should have, could have, would have" thinking is flawed.

In the face of uncertainty, remember that your principles are your anchor, and your strategies are your sails. Outcomes are often beyond your control, but your dedication to sound decision-making is what truly defines your journey. Accept the randomness of life, adapt when necessary, but always stay true to your guiding values.

No one can guarantee a specific outcome, but you can guarantee your commitment to doing the best you can with what you have. Let go of the "should haves," embrace the lessons, and move forward with conviction. The future is unwritten, but you hold the pen - write your story with courage, integrity, and resilience.
