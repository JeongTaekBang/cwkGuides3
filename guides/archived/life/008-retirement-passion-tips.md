# Quick Tips for Soon-to-Be Retirees on How to Spend Their Time Passionately, Like They Once Did as Kids

Yeah, it's a cheesy title, but the tips here might change your life. Just give it a try.

As a happily retired old-timer, I can safely say that this works.

But, as I emphasized in previous posts, to change your ingrained biases and perspectives, you need to be open to new ideas and experiences for a long time. Don't forget that.

Remember that moving average thing? The longer the period, the more reliable the signal. It's the same with changing your perspectives. The longer you try something new, the more likely you are to enjoy it. Your ingrained biases are like those moving averages plummeting downward. You need to reverse that trend, and to do so, you need to give it enough time. Still remember this simple concept, right?

For example, you might dislike activities that others enjoy, like gaming. You tried it once, but it didn't click.

Have you considered that you might not have given it enough time? Or that you weren't in the right mood or condition?

What if you're missing out on a lifelong passion without even knowing it?

I've been a gaming fanatic forever, but I was late to the party with the Soulsborne series. When I first tried Dark Souls III and Bloodborne, I couldn't stand them. Now? They're some of my all-time favorites. I gave them another shot years later and boom - totally hooked. It sends shivers down my spine thinking I nearly missed out on games I now absolutely adore.

I hated heavy metal in high school, but Metallica and Megadeth turned me around in my early 20s. Now, I'm a serious headbanger and even play metal on my guitar.

Drawing? Who would have thought I'd be drawing like a maniac in my 50s?

Your biases and hardened perspectives are your worst enemies. Skipping something because you think you won't like it means missing out on a lot. It's like skipping an entire drama series or a fantastic book series because you didn't like the first episode or chapter. Chilling thought, isn't it?

That's the key insight from this post. Give any potential activity a try or another try if you've tried it before. But this time, give it a real try. Be passionate about it. You might be surprised, like I was when I started drawing.

Consider activities like:
- Gaming
- Drawing (both digital and traditional)
- 3D modeling and sculpting
- Photography
- Videography
- Cinematography
- Writing
- Coding
- Cooking
- Machine learning
- AI research
- Composing music
- Playing an instrument or instruments
- Singing
- Dancing
- Acting
- Voice acting

You know what? I do all of these to some degree and some at professional levels. And I'm not even close to being bored. I'm still passionate, still learning, and still excited.

You can be too. Just give it enough of a try. At least a month, seriously investing mentally, physically, and financially. Don't be stingy, especially financially. If you're serious, you should be willing to invest. Your inner self won't be fooled if you're only serious in words, not actions.

Some of you know me. Doing those things listed above, I've invested like most professionals would. I've bought the best tools I could afford. I've spent hours learning and practicing. I've spent a lot of money. And I'm still doing it.

That's what being serious means. As serious as Serious Sam. (I don't like that game, but I like its cheesy humor.)

If you're pre-retirement, you can have a head start. Seek something you might be passionate about. Give it a try. Be serious. Invest in it. Be passionate. You might be surprised how much you enjoy it.

If you're already retired but haven't found your passion yet, it's not too late. That fact alone should make your heart pump with excitement. You have time to find it and enjoy it. Get that booze out of your system and start searching. You might find it in the most unexpected place. Especially those of you losing tons of money in the market, wake up and start searching. You might find something that makes you forget about the market. That's how you protect your portfolio, your hard-earned money, your loved ones, and most importantly, your sanity.

Good luck, you lucky bastards! You have all the time in the world to find your passion!

And by the way, it's not that I don't care about you ladies; it's just a fact that men can be stupider. I trust you to find your passion without my help. You're smarter than us, and you know it.


Happily Retired, Ever After
