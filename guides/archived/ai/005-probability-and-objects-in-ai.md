# Stats and Objects: The Two Pillars You Can't Dodge in AI

If you asked me what's the absolute cornerstone before diving into AI, I'd say probability and statistics without missing a beat.

Talk about efficiency – it's not just catching two birds with one stone. We're talking about snagging an entire flock here. Like I keep hammering home, stats is one of those beautiful life hacks that keeps you from stumbling into unnecessary pitfalls.

And when it comes to AI? The connection's so obvious it practically hits you in the face. AI mirrors human intelligence, and what's intelligence if not a massive probability engine working with objects and patterns? Heck, zoom out far enough and you'll see that every single darn thing in our universe dances to the tune of probability and statistics, all while following object-oriented principles. Just look at quantum mechanics – it's probability all the way down, with each quantum state behaving like a perfectly encapsulated object. Uncertainty isn't just some academic concept; it's woven into the very fabric of reality.

Remember when I was playing "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" on YouTube and got all philosophical and scientific about the uncertainty principle while Link stood before a shrine puzzle? It's a perfect example of probability and optimization at work. Think about it - until Link steps inside, that shrine's interior doesn't exist in the game's memory. It's like Schrödinger's dungeon - both there and not there until you open the door. And when Link leaves? Poof! That memory space gets cleared, ready for the next area. Even the way the game handles distant terrain, getting blurrier the further you look - that's not just a technical limitation, it's brilliant optimization. Why waste resources rendering details the player can barely see? The game engine is basically running probability calculations, deciding what's worth loading based on player position and likelihood of interaction. It's a masterclass in statistical thinking and resource management. The Creator clearly knows their stuff when it comes to probability, optimization, and object-oriented design - but we'll dive deeper into that last bit later.

Speaking of massive probability calculations at work - let's talk about LLMs. They're essentially sophisticated probability engines that predict the next most likely token in a sequence based on their training data. Each prediction is a statistical calculation drawing from patterns they've learned. Sure, they seem magical, but at their core, they're just really good at playing the probability game - figuring out what words or tokens are most likely to come next given what came before. And we're not talking about a simple game of chance here - we're dealing with probability distributions across vocabularies of hundreds of thousands of tokens, with each token's probability influenced by potentially billions of parameters. The sheer scale of these calculations is mind-boggling - we're talking about mathematical operations happening at a level that would take a human millions of years to compute manually. It's probability at a scale that transcends human comprehension.

Extend this concept infinitely, and you'll see that probability and statistics aren't just tools for AI - they're the fundamental fabric of our universe. Picture a limitless probability engine with infinite computational power. It's like playing the ultimate version of Baldur's Gate where every single interaction - from the tiniest particle collision to the grandest cosmic event - is determined by rolling infinite-sided dice. Every object, every force, every quantum state is constantly participating in this cosmic game of chance. When you really think about it, that's exactly how our universe operates - one massive probability engine running an infinite number of calculations every instant. Mind-blowing, right?

And you think you can skate by without learning stats? Your innocence is almost endearing. Here's the deal - you're going to crash headfirst into stats-related concepts the moment you start diving into AI or ML. It's not a question of if, but when. So why not get ahead of the game? The thing is, most AI and ML resources assume you've got a solid grasp of statistics already. And let me tell you - their idea of "basic stats knowledge" is probably way more advanced than you're thinking. Without the right foundation, you're setting yourself up to get overwhelmed fast. Do yourself a favor and start building those stats muscles now. Trust me, your future self will thank you.

Let's be real here - your stats knowledge probably isn't where it needs to be. And I'm not talking about formulas or data crunching. I'm talking about seeing the bigger picture - that higher-level understanding where statistics becomes a lens through which you view the world. Most folks think they've got stats figured out because they can work through textbook problems. But real mastery? That's about developing an intuition for patterns, understanding how randomness shapes everything around us, and seeing the statistical nature of reality itself.

Look, we're all growing in this area. Traditional stats education focuses too much on calculations and not enough on building that statistical intuition - that ability to step back and see how probability weaves through every aspect of life. Those exams? They're testing mechanics when they should be testing vision - your ability to recognize statistical patterns in everything from market trends to natural phenomena, from human behavior to quantum mechanics.

Here's a truth bomb for you: if you can't see the normal distribution dancing through your everyday life, you're not really getting statistics yet. And I'm not talking about memorizing that bell curve formula - I'm talking about recognizing probability's fingerprints on everything around you. Nature is obsessed with normal distributions. They're like the universe's favorite template: human heights, measurement errors, stock market returns, biological variations - heck, even your coffee brewing times probably follow a bell curve without you realizing it.

Think about it - when was the last time you stood in Starbucks and noticed how most orders cluster around a few popular drinks, with fewer people going for the really weird stuff? Or how social media engagement follows that same pattern - most posts get average attention, while viral hits and total flops are rare? Every piece of folk wisdom, every common saying, every cultural norm - they're all sampled from the fat middle of the normal distribution of human experiences. That's why they resonate with so many people - they represent the most common patterns of reality that humans have encountered over and over. When millions of people over centuries experience similar patterns, those insights get crystallized into sayings and wisdom that capture the statistical center of human experience.

Now here's another mind-bender for you. Take the Dark Forest theory from Cixin Liu's Three-Body trilogy - it's a perfect example of statistical thinking applied to cosmic ethics. Think about it: human morality follows a normal distribution, right? Most of us cluster around similar ethical principles, with extremes on either end. But here's the kicker - why would aliens follow our bell curve of morality? They're fundamentally different beings, shaped by entirely different evolutionary pressures and environments. They'd likely have their own statistical distribution of ethical behaviors - if they even have what we'd recognize as morality at all. That's the brilliant insight at the heart of the Dark Forest theory. Our ethical frameworks? They're distinctly human constructs, emerging from our particular statistical distribution of behaviors and values. And speaking of human constructs - look at religion. Our concepts of gods and the divine? That's another human bell curve right there, another statistical clustering of beliefs and experiences that aliens might view as completely foreign to their own probability distributions of existence and meaning.

If you've read the Three-Body trilogy but haven't grasped its deep statistical implications, you're missing the entire point. The universe isn't just randomly chaotic - it's a masterpiece of probability distributions playing out at cosmic scales. The Dark Forest theory itself is a brilliant exploration of statistical game theory across civilizations. Without understanding this statistical foundation, you're just skimming the surface of both the books and reality itself. Time to level up your perspective.

You know what kills me? Most folks walk through life completely blind to these patterns. They're swimming in an ocean of probability distributions but can't feel the water. It's like having statistical superpowers and choosing to keep your eyes closed. Once you start seeing these patterns, you can't unsee them. And that's exactly what you need for AI - not just knowing the formulas, but having that deep, gut-level understanding of how probability shapes everything.

Now, for the second foundation stone: object-oriented thinking. I bang this drum constantly, and for good reason. And no, I'm not talking about just knowing how to write classes and methods. That's like saying you understand art because you can hold a pencil.

Remember how we talked about the universe being one massive probability engine? Well, guess what - that engine is built on objects all the way down. Each probability calculation is an object, each potential outcome is an object, each decision point is an object. And just like our transformer architectures, they all inherit from fundamental patterns. The universe isn't just running infinite probability calculations - it's running them through an infinitely complex object-oriented system.

Let me paint you a picture of what real object-oriented thinking looks like in AI. When you're working with neural networks? Each layer is an object that transforms data in a specific way. The whole network is just objects talking to each other, passing messages (data) back and forth. Sound familiar? That's because it's exactly how object-oriented systems work.

Take transformers - the architecture behind your favorite LLMs. You've got self-attention objects, feed-forward objects, normalization objects, each doing their specialized thing but working together in this beautiful dance of information processing. And guess what? Once you understand one transformer architecture, you can understand them all. Why? Because they inherit from the same basic principles. GPT, BERT, T5 - they're all just different children of the same parent class, each with its own unique implementation.

Even the MOE (Mixture of Experts) architecture and Diffusion Transformer follow this inheritance pattern. Think about it - MOE is basically taking the transformer and saying 'Hey, what if each component was itself a collection of specialized experts?' It's like inheritance with a twist of delegation. Instead of one object handling a task, you've got a committee of expert objects, each inheriting from the same base but specialized for different cases. And Diffusion Transformers? They're taking the same base architecture and adapting it for the reverse process - going from noise to signal. They're both just specialized implementations that inherit from the same foundational principles, spiced up with some clever polymorphism. Strip away all the fancy additions and what do you find? Their ultimate ancestor is still that basic abstract transformer class. And if you keep climbing up that inheritance tree, what's waiting at the very top? You guessed it - the mother of all abstractions: the pure, pristine concept of an object itself!

Want another mind-blower? From the perspective of universal scale, every single thing is fundamentally an object. Think about it - that means our ultimate ancestor is that pure, abstract object class. You, me, that LLM you're tinkering with - we're all inheriting from the same cosmic parent class. We're literally one big object-oriented family tree. Evolution itself? It's just nature's way of implementing polymorphism, creating specialized subclasses to handle different environmental challenges. Consciousness? Maybe it's just a particularly complex method that emerged from the base object class. Every scientific discovery we make is essentially us reverse-engineering the methods and properties of our parent classes. And if that concept doesn't send shivers down your spine and make you question reality itself, I don't know what will. The universe isn't just running on probability - it's the ultimate object-oriented program, and we're all just instances trying to understand our inherited methods.

Here's the humongous kicker – even if you master stats, without object-oriented thinking, you're just collecting statistical tools like a magpie collects shiny things. But an object-oriented mind? They learn stats once, inherit that foundation, and apply it everywhere, layering abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation like a master chef combining flavors.

And let's talk about data preprocessing - you know, that unglamorous but crucial part of AI work. An object-oriented thinker sees each preprocessing step as an object that transforms data in a specific way. Need to normalize some values? That's an object. Need to handle missing data? Another object. Need to encode categorical variables? You guessed it - object. Chain them together, and you've got a pipeline. Inherit from a base preprocessor class, and you can create new preprocessing steps without reinventing the wheel.

Most folks hit a wall in AI when the complexity starts mounting. Why? Because they're trying to keep track of everything at once. But when you think in objects, you naturally break things down into manageable chunks. Each chunk does one thing and does it well. That's encapsulation at work. Need to modify how your model handles a specific type of data? Just modify that object. Everything else keeps working because they only care about the interface, not the implementation. That's abstraction and polymorphism singing in harmony.

Learn once, apply everywhere. That's the object-oriented magic.

Want to know why the best AI practitioners seem to pick up new architectures and techniques so quickly? Because they're not learning everything from scratch each time. They're seeing the patterns, the objects, the interactions. They're thinking in systems, in abstractions, in objects.

Like I always preach, you need a solid base to build upon – that's your inheritance in object-oriented terms. The way you use it? That's polymorphism. Knowing what to focus on? That's encapsulation – boxing up the non-essential stuff for later. But none of this works without abstraction skills. You need to develop that special vision that sees past the surface to the essence – like how artists squint to see basic shapes instead of details. Speaking of art, isn't it funny how drawing also starts with abstraction? Object-orientation strikes again.

Everything in this universe is an object, and nothing's completely new. You always find something familiar to build on, to enhance your understanding, to make the unfamiliar feel like home.

Get the picture? Now go hit those stats books.

But here's a pro tip: Don't torture yourself learning statistics in isolation. Weave it into your AI or ML journey. Makes it way more engaging and practical.

Remember, stats is inevitable in your future. Why not get friendly with it now?

And about my daily drawing practice? Think about it. Really think about it.
