# Monetizing Open Sourcing Efforts

As someone who's been around the block a few times, let me share a thought or two on making a buck from open-sourcing your work.

It seems no matter how much you spell it out, those new to the open-source world still scratch their heads, wondering, "How can you make money from this?" 

Take a moment to mull over this straightforward idea: over time, those who are more skilled should naturally earn more than their less skilled counterparts, all else being equal.

It's a universally acknowledged truth: open sourcing is the ultimate method to learn, enhance, and demonstrate your skills. The instant you decide to open source your creations, you're catapulted into a battlefield, competing against the cream of the crop and the sharpest minds, pushing you to learn and evolve without the veil of privacy.

It's really about what you prioritize. I'm not about to claim that open sourcing is the top way to rake in cash since not everyone opts for that route.

What I mean is this: dipping your toes into the world of open source can fine-tune your abilities in ways you wouldn't have experienced otherwise. It can even transform your entire outlook on life.

In any competitive field, it's a no-brainer who'd come out on top if they decided to throw their hat in the ring. It's all about what you value more.

Take my little GitHub project on AI, for example: https://cwkai.net

Not a single penny made, but the knowledge and growth I've gained? Priceless. I wouldn't swap that learning curve for any quick cash.

Moreover, who would have known about me beyond Korea if I hadn't open sourced my work? Writing my first book in English was possible thanks to the visibility I got from sharing a small PHP project. And now, the AI community is getting to know me because of my AI project. See what I mean?

As a company, Meta is a prime example of this approach. Reflect on it. They're successfully moving past the challenges faced during the Facebook era, owing to their dedication to open source projects. Without this endeavor, I wouldn't have taken an interest in them at all. You'll grasp my point if you're familiar with the company's history. They've been displaying their technological progress throughout this journey. By the way, PyTorch is my preferred framework. Consider how they reached this point. 

And yes, some still wonder, asking if I could ever monetize my efforts if I chose to. It's similar to questioning Meta on how they could profit from their open source projects.

I'll let your imagination run with that one. Honestly, I've leveraged my experience from it to manage my own AI portfolio. Take a wild guess at how that's turning out.

It's not about whether you can earn money directly from open sourcing; it's about how you can use the skills you've sharpened to make money in other areas.

It all adds up eventually. That's why there's a saying: the journey itself is the reward. I've been contributing to open source since my twenties. Throughout this time, I've been constantly learning and evolving, and I'm still going strong. I haven't earned a dime directly from open sourcing, but all of it has contributed to making me who I am today. Let that really sink in.
This logic applies to companies too. My money's on the most competent in the long run. 

Now, take a look at Meta. Are they losing money? Far from it; they're flourishing. Just consider the reasons WHY.

That's the perspective from which I assess my investments. I get it because I'm part of that world. If I'm not already, I aim to be.

You don't invest in something because it's currently profitable, but because it has the potential to be profitable in the future. Without this insight, you could be overlooking the most promising opportunities.

Just take a close look at who has been involved in open source. History has already made it clear.  Keep in mind, some simply opt not to monetize their efforts. Don't misunderstand their intentions. 

Curiously, those who truly understand the benefits of participating in open source keep doing it. 

That's exactly what I'm doing.
