# If I Were You

![](images/010-1.png)

If I were you...

I would focus solely on understanding what AI truly is at its core—diving deep beneath the surface, without shortcuts.

I wouldn't get swept up in the hype until I've experienced the fundamentals firsthand. Hype without understanding is a recipe for failure.

I wouldn't cling to outdated methods just to stay comfortable. The world is changing, and resisting it is not only futile but dangerous.

Either way, the risk is yours—and it could cost you everything.

Let me be clear: if you don't grasp what I'm saying here, you don't understand AI as well as you think you do. And this lack of understanding? It’s the fastest route to missing AI's true potential and real dangers.

If I were you...

I’d keep pushing, keep studying AI until all doubts fade, until fear turns into knowledge.

Without that dedication, any move you make is a gamble. And it's not a gamble I would take.

Don't look to me for answers—I have none for you. If there are still questions, it's on you to find those answers.

I’m retired, truly. I have no room to hold your anxieties or fears.

Still, here I am, more immersed in AI than most. Life has a strange sense of irony like that.
