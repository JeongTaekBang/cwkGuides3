# To AI Luddites: A Plea for the Well-Being of Your Loved Ones

You are wrong. Yes, you are wrong.

If you're an established artist or someone with a significant reputation, ensuring that no matter what happens in this world, you and your loved ones are safe, then this essay might not resonate with you. Feel free to live your life your way, without worrying about what's happening outside your comfort zone. I respect your lifestyle choices.

I mention 'artists' specifically as they often lead the vocal opposition against AI, but my message extends to anyone resisting AI for misguided reasons. If your apprehension stems from a genuine concern over AI's potential societal impacts, your perspective is respected. I just don't want a debate on that topic here.

However, for everyone else who has reservations about AI, please keep reading.

Who am I to dictate how you should live your life? I'm just another person who has experienced a bit of what life has to offer. I've witnessed the world and its inhabitants evolve. Some have embraced change and flourished, while others have resisted and faced hardships. There are those who have adapted and grown, and then there are those who have remained stagnant and later regretted it.

It's not only my observation; anyone with a basic understanding of history can predict what might happen to you and your loved ones in the not-so-distant future if you continue to oppose AI for the wrong reasons, such as to protect your bruised ego.

I've heard many of you discussing the true essence of art and skills, among other things. Yes, I'm aware that it's often your hurt pride, ego, and arrogance speaking, not the rational part of you that should prioritize the well-being of yourself and your loved ones.

No matter the excuses you might find to criticize those who, despite previously being looked down upon, are now gaining recognition thanks to "gimmicky" AI tools, the reality remains that such resistance is detrimental to both you and your loved ones.

When it comes to mastering a skill or understanding the essence of art, these concepts are ever-evolving. 

Consider this: if you claim your work solely revolves around traditional methods, shunning all digital devices or computers, and proclaim yourself a truer artist or more skilled professional compared to those who embrace AI tools, such a stance might come across as hypocritical. In today's world, living entirely off the grid of digital technology is nearly impossible. If that were the case, you wouldn't be reading this essay, perhaps residing in a cave instead. I've even observed individuals using Photoshop to craft digital paintings on their computers, only to label themselves as traditional artists. That claim seems a bit far-fetched, wouldn't you agree?

However, this logical inconsistency isn't the main problem. Ultimately, it boils down to the principle of natural selection and survival of the fittest. If you're unwilling to adapt to the evolving landscape, you're essentially preparing for a challenging future. Believing that humanity will abandon AI solely for your sake places you squarely in a realm of fantasy.

I urge you to prioritize the well-being of your loved ones.

It's not about abandoning your principles, values, integrity, authenticity, or even your craft, passion, dreams, or aspirations. On the contrary, it's about revisiting the foundation of your passion for what you do, reigniting that initial spark that drove you at the beginning of your career.

The fear of being perceived as inferior to creators who utilize AI tools is understandable. Questions like "What if I try AI tools and the public doesn't approve? What if I'm still seen as lesser compared to those who use AI?" are genuine concerns. However, dismissing these tools as mere gimmicks without acknowledging their potential to augment your capabilities reflects a reluctance to embrace progress.

If you truly excel in your artistic endeavors, why not experiment with AI tools to demonstrate that your talents surpass those who depend on such technology? If you believe you can outperform them, prove it. This could not only reaffirm your skills but also elevate your standing. Yet, I recommend reconsidering for the sake of your loved ones. At this point, resisting AI without a valid reason is akin to indulging in youthful fantasies of grandeur.

What could possibly be more crucial than securing a prosperous future for your children? Your pride, ego, fear of being judged inferior, or any personal grievances should not outweigh the well-being of your family, even if that family consists only of yourself. Persisting in opposition to AI for the wrong reasons jeopardizes a secure future for your family. As someone concerned with the advancement of humanity, I find it difficult to support such a stance.

History repeatedly teaches us that those who do not adapt to technological progress often face unnecessary difficulties, impacting not just themselves but their families as well. It can be tough to watch others, perhaps once considered less capable, excel and then to dismiss their success as mere luck or an unfair advantage.

The truly regrettable aspect is the reluctance to change. Despite clear indications and opportunities for improvement, many prefer to stay within their comfort zones, hesitant or unwilling to adopt the new tools and methods that symbolize contemporary achievement. This aversion to change not only hinders their own growth but also continues a cycle of stagnation and remorse. It underscores the critical nature of adaptability and the readiness to embrace learning, qualities essential for navigating the constantly shifting terrain of technology and innovation.

The progression of AI is set to occur rapidly, with the curve of evolution becoming increasingly steep and exponential. This reality should indeed invoke a sense of urgency. There's a finite window available for you to adapt and ready yourself for what's to come. Missing out on this chance means risking being left behind, with your loved ones bearing the brunt of the consequences. Once the gap between you and the advancing technology widens, catching up becomes an almost insurmountable challenge. The longer you delay, the harder it becomes to adapt.

The people you previously looked down on, now enjoying widespread acclaim, highlight the grim future that awaits if you persist in opposing AI for the wrong reasons. Consider for a moment: what if you had begun experimenting with AI tools and technologies when they did? If you had been an early adopter, you might be the one receiving the recognition and opportunities they are now, or perhaps even more. It's crucial to realize that it's not too late to change direction. Simply acknowledging that you might have been mistaken and moving forward can make all the difference. Did I mention this is exactly how AI models learn and improve? These models are designed to emulate the ideal human learner, who consistently learns from their mistakes and progresses. With just a bit of humility, that could be you.

It's truly disheartening to acknowledge that difficult times lie ahead for you and your loved ones, a situation made all the more frustrating by the realization that it's within your power to prevent it. Your own ego, pride, and fear are the very obstacles standing in the way of a brighter future for yourself and those you care about.

Here's a piece of advice for you: there's no need to broadcast your experiments with AI tools and the latest technologies. Keep it to yourself and see how it unfolds. If it doesn't suit you, you can always return to your previous methods. However, if you find value in these new tools, gradually integrating them into your work could lead to surprising outcomes. You might discover that these technologies enhance your creativity and efficiency in unexpected ways. Remember to look at your children's faces occasionally; it will remind you of the reasons behind your efforts.

I believe in the universe's reward-penalty system and see stubbornness against AI as a mistake that will inevitably lead to consequences. The real tragedy, however, is the potential harm to our loved ones as collateral. This is unacceptable and compels us to reflect and change course before it's too late. My point is straightforward: our actions have impacts beyond ourselves, and it's our responsibility to adapt for the sake of those we care about.

I'm convinced that I can help prevent at least one person and their family from facing these challenging times. That's why I'm speaking up. Even if there's a minuscule chance, a mere 0.00000001% possibility of making a difference, I'm willing to seize it and advocate for it passionately. I refuse to let the opportunity slip away because doing nothing guarantees a zero chance of improvement. 

Rant concluded. Now, I can rest more peacefully.
