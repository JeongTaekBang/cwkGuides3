# Unpacking Templates: The Importance of Questioning Life's Design

![image](images/002-1.png)

Just like every game has a design philosophy and a purpose created by its designer, so does your life. By intentionally seeking to understand this design, you can illuminate the guiding stars in your life. The more you comprehend the underlying design, the clearer your purpose and path will become.

The Plain Doll in Bloodborne might say something like this if you interact with her enough:

"Hunters have told me about the church. About the gods, and their love. But, do the gods love their creations? Would you ever think to love me? Of course, I do love you. Isn't that how you've made me?"

When I pose a question like this, some might respond with, "If we are designed to love our Creator, how can we even question it?"

Good question. Study statistics and grasp the concepts of determinism and stochasticity or randomness. You'll understand that even if we are designed to love our Creator, we can still question it. A truly wise Creator wouldn't limit His creations within the boundaries of determinism. That's why we have free will—a margin of error on the Creator's part, if you will.

Here, 'Creator' is used in a general, non-religious sense.

The grand premise is that this whole universe has been created by an entity far beyond our comprehension. We are part of this grand design. If you question this premise, you're questioning your own existence. The whole universe operates on universal principles, hence the term "universal."

Don't question the Creator itself. Question the design and why you are part of it. Because questioning ultimately benefits us. I'm not trying to conjure up another sci-fi scenario here. I'm just trying to make you think about why we should question the design. This reflection can provide huge insights into our own existence and how to live our lives.

Just pause and think about it. I said "think," not just let your consciousness stream without using any brain power. Use your brain and think hard, feeling the heat of your brain cells. Then you will understand why we should question and understand the design, like it or not.

Consider what you do when thrown into a new game. Seasoned players try to understand the design philosophy and intentions of the game's creator. Even if you hate the game's physics, you still try to understand it to avoid falling to your death, for example. Every game has a design philosophy. Every game has a creator. Every game has a purpose.

Yes, your life has a purpose. You should intentionally figure out what it is. That's how you light up guiding stars in your life. The more you understand the design, the more you understand your purpose, and the clearer your path becomes.

Are you with me so far? Okay then. Let's move on.

When we encounter unfathomable beings in life, three things happen: We either fear them, worship them, or try to understand them. Fear and worship are easily understood since that's what we still do. But understanding them is a different story. Hubris may lead us to think we can fully understand and control them. Those with enormous hubris even go so far as to think they can become them. Yeah, that's how the Tower of Babel was built, right?

I'm not talking about any religious stuff here. It's just a tried-and-true template humanity has been following since the dawn of time. One such template you're already familiar with is the hero's journey. Since it is time-tested and proven to work, you shouldn't alter it. Some try to adapt too much of the template in their art, and it becomes a mess. Many bombed movies and dramas are the result of this. These time-tested templates are there for a reason. They've been refined to the point where they are almost perfect.

Another template is the "fear of the unknown." This powerful template can be used in any genre. Lovecraftian horror is a prime example, where the fear of the unknown becomes a potent tool in the hands of a skilled writer. Hidetaka Miyazaki's Bloodborne closely follows this narrative, with the Great Ones inspired by Lovecraftian horrors. When humans encounter these beings, they either fear, worship, or try to understand them, sometimes even attempting to become them. As they say in the Bible, we all did in the past.
Yeah, it's just a powerful template.

Random, stochastic elements in created beings are what make them interesting. If they were purely deterministic, they would simply fear or worship the Great Ones, which would be quite boring. It's the random elements that fuel their hubris, driving them to understand and even attempt to become the Great Ones themselves. Amusing, isn't it?

Of course, even in the universe of the Great Ones, the same principles apply since they too have a certain hierarchy, pecking order, if you will.

Interestingly enough, in this template, there's a subtle hint that the Great Ones themselves are trying to understand the universe they are in, and they're both Creators and Created. Yes, a paradoxical existence where they embody both roles simultaneously.

Prometheus, the movie, anyone?

It's all from a template and its variations. Both the hero's journey and the fear of the unknown template started with myths and legends. They are the oldest templates in human history. Hence the most time-tested and refined. Statistically speaking, they're the most successful and perfect templates.

Now, from an object-oriented mindset, try to understand the following narratives from various media and see if you can spot the templates: movies, dramas, games, books, etc.

1. Star Wars
2. Lord of the Rings
3. Bloodborne
4. Dark Souls Series
5. Elden Ring
6. Game of Thrones
7. The Matrix
8. Blade Runner
9. Alien Series
10. Prometheus
11. Three Body Problem

The two templates, most of the time, go hand in hand since the hero's journey is about understanding the unknown through trials and tribulations.

**Star Wars** is the most basic example of the hero's journey. It's so straightforward that it's almost a parody of itself. You can pick a character and name their role in the template so easily that it's almost laughable. But remember that it was a huge success because it was so basic and easy to understand. You shouldn't alter the template too much. Just follow it, and you'll be fine. Even in life, you can follow the hero's journey. It's a universal template that works in any situation. An easy way to understand the design of the universe, right?

If you follow the template of the hero's journey, your life will be next to perfect. You'll have a purpose, a goal, and a guiding star. You'll be a hero in your own story. Laughably easy, but only a few can follow it. That's the sad part. However, if everybody did it, what fun would it be? That's its magic: it's so easy that everyone questions its validity. That's the paradox of the hero's journey.

Now, the Lovecraftian "fear of the unknown" template is a bit more complex, often escaping our immediate thoughts.

Haruki Murakami's **1Q84** or Hidetaka Miyazaki's **Bloodborne** are prime examples of the fear of the unknown template so well adapted that you can't even be sure if they follow the template.

**Three Body Problem** is a great example of the "fear of the unknown" template with a twist. It's a bit more complex than the other examples, but it still follows this template. Without getting into spoilers, the Dark Forest theory, central to the second book in the series, illustrates this concept. The essence is that there is no single Creator at the top of the hierarchy. Instead, it's an endless cycle of survival and existential threats, where even godly beings are disposable heroes in the eyes of higher powers.

If you haven't, you should read the entire **Three Body Problem** series, not just rely on drama adaptations. It's a mind-blowing experience that will make you question the grand design of the universe.

There might be an ultimate Creator, but you just won't be able to know where the rabbit hole ends.

Haruki Murakami knows this, and so does Hidetaka Miyazaki. That's why they always include the concept of "outer gods" or their variations, indicating a higher hierarchy. Less imaginative artists, or those fearful of overwhelming the audience with too much depth, tend to avoid this concept. They stick to the hero's journey and fear of the unknown templates—obvious and somewhat boring paths if done wrong or too often, especially by the same artist.

In **1Q84**, the Little People represent fearful beings beyond human comprehension. However, they also fear other beings that might be considered outer gods. The cycle of fear and worship is never-ending. Humans exhibit the same behavioral patterns towards the Little People in the novel: fear, worship, and an attempt to understand and fight them.

In any of Miyazaki's works, including **Dark Souls**, **Bloodborne**, **Elden Ring**, and even **Sekiro**, you can see the same pattern. They all have some forms of outer gods.

The player, you, might follow the hero's journey faithfully and even die for your apparent Creator. What a boring narrative, right? We might call it a normal or good ending, but in actuality, from Miyazaki's standpoint, it is a bad ending. Because you didn't understand the grander design and became a disposable hero as the gods intended. In Miyazaki's worldview, these gods don't necessarily love their creations. They use them when needed and dispose of them when they're not. Miyazaki makes sure you see this from the start by showing an endless supply of disposable heroes: so many Tarnished in **Elden Ring**, Ashen Ones in **Dark Souls**, and Hunters in **Bloodborne**. They're all disposable heroes in the eyes of the gods

"Arise, Tarnished. Your lord calls you, remember?"

Put yourself in the shoes of a Creator. Do you honestly claim that you love your AI models the way you wish your Creator loved you? Look at what we are doing as creators. The theme of so many dark sci-fi movies and books revolves around humans mistreating their creations. We're already doing it. Why should we think our Creator is any different?

Let's humor this idea a bit more. Take **Elden Ring**, for example. All those gods and demigods, and outer gods like Frenzied Flame are unfathomably fearful entities, right? Compare them with Miyazaki, the creator of the game itself. They don’t mean much in comparison. And Miyazaki? A great human, but still just a human. Zoom out a bit. In this whole universe, even some forms of godly figures wouldn't mean much if we continue to zoom out in their infinite hierarchy.

Back to the foundation. From an object-oriented perspective, templates are inherited common denominators, a solid foundation of pattern recognition. Even if a narrative or concept seems a bit or even way off from the template, if it shares the same pool of attributes and behaviors, they’re just polymorphic variations.

In the previous essay, "What Makes the Soulsborne Genre Unique," I talked about why some would-be Miyazakis fail in delivering appealing narratives, although they closely follow the template. Now you know why. They don't understand the grand or grander design as much as Haruki or Miyazaki do.

You should be able to zoom in or out in terms of perspectives and patterns, transcending domains.

Now, you might ask, what does this all have to do with how you should live your life?

If you really wonder that, I'm pretty disappointed in you. Because that's a smoking gun of you not thinking at all.

Here's a pop quiz for good measure: What would people think about AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, the next big unfathomable entity we're bound to face sooner than later? Draw a normal distribution of people's understanding of artificial intelligence and imagine those ranges of people facing AGI. What would they do? Fear, worship, try to understand, or even merge with it? What would you do?

That's one way of utilizing templates, statistics, and object-oriented thinking in real life. Here's a hint: we already have tons of sci-fi fictions and movies about this. It's just that we are about to face it in real life.

Now, incorporate more of these exercises into your daily life until you no longer question the connection between the grand design and your own life.

Oh, did I mention that templates can also be called patterns? And object-oriented programming is all about patterns? And patterns are all about recognizing the grand design?

There you go.
