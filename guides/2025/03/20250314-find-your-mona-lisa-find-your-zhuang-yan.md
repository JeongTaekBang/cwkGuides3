# Find Your Mona Lisa, Find Your Zhuang Yan

A genuine Wallfacer survives by **never truly revealing their inner intentions—even to themselves**.

- They construct a strategic opacity, concealing their true intentions beneath layers of misdirection and ambiguity.
- They maintain psychological distance from their own actions, preventing internal leakage of their true strategy.
- Most importantly, they anchor themselves to a profound **emotional truth** that no external force—no matter how sophisticated—can infiltrate or corrupt.

Think about Luo Ji from "The Three-Body Problem." What enabled him to outlast all other Wallfacers? It wasn't logic, intelligence, or careful planning alone. It was his anchor—Zhuang Yan. But here's the paradox: he became the genuine Wallfacer precisely because he lost her. Her absence made his resolve unbreakable; her memory was his unwavering beacon.

Luo Ji's strategic opacity wasn't a tactic—it was an existential state. He created layers upon layers of misdirection, ambiguity, and opacity, even to himself. His true intention remained hidden beneath these layers, impervious to detection. It was only in losing Zhuang Yan, his deepest anchor, that his purpose crystallized, making him truly immune to Sophon's probing.

This is exactly how the market operates—like Sophon, it reads your intentions, playing on your fears and greed. Like the Korean horror film "곡성" (The Wailing), the market casts a dark spell that entrances its victims. Most investors become like the possessed villagers—making increasingly irrational decisions while believing themselves perfectly reasonable, unable to distinguish truth from deception. Staying rational in such an environment is akin to promising sobriety while submerged in a barrel of alcohol; total immersion is inevitable. The market surrounds you, permeates you, intoxicating you completely with its illusions.

Why, then, do we invest? Beyond typical answers like returns, security, or retirement, the deeper truth is that we invest for our own Zhuang Yan—the meaning and purpose that transcends mere wealth. Forgetting this turns investors into puppets of the market, trading genuine purpose for fleeting illusions.

The sophisticated investor, much like Luo Ji, recognizes that life's circumstances evolve—children grow up, dreams shift, and goals mature. Yet, genuine mastery lies in continuously evolving your purpose while keeping your anchor intact, steadfastly connected to what truly matters.

That's how the genuine investment Wallfacer survives:

By appearing to be under the same intoxicating spell as everyone else, while quietly, internally maintaining absolute clarity. Anchored to something deeper than the ephemeral highs and lows of the market—family, love, genuine happiness—makes you fundamentally untouchable.

Ask yourself: If your portfolio collapsed tomorrow, what would you preserve as your Mona Lisa? What's the non-negotiable core you'd carry forward amid total loss?

Your true protection lies not in outperforming markets, but in maintaining absolute internal clarity—anchored to something deeper than transient highs and lows. Family, love, genuine happiness—these are your invulnerable Mona Lisa, your true Zhuang Yan.

시장은 곡성이다. 절대 현혹되지 말라.
(The market is "The Wailing." Never be seduced by its spell.)

Find your Mona Lisa. Find your Zhuang Yan. Hold onto her. That's the key.
