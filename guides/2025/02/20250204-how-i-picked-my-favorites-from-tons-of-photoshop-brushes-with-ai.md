# How I Picked My Favorites from Tons of Photoshop Brushes with AI

![The Blade Whispers Her Story, Fate Listens](images/20250204-01.png)

When you collect a massive number of Photoshop brushes—whether you buy them or download them for free—there’s a common problem: too many brushes, and too little information on how or when to use them. 

My favorite brush pack at the moment is Lane’s Photoshop Master Pack (look it up if you’re curious; I’m leaving out links to avoid any misunderstandings). I just happen to love it. The downside? This pack includes an extensive collection of brushes that can feel overwhelming at first glance.

![Master Pack Part 1](images/01-Master-Pack-Essential-Quick-Line-Painterly-Brushes.png)

![Master Pack Part 2](images/02-Master-Pack-Essential-Mixer-Brushes.png)

![Master Pack Part 4](images/04-Master-Pack-Dirty-Ink-Brushes.png)

![Master Pack Part 5](images/05-Master-Pack-Special-Effects-Smudge-Tools-Erasers.png)

Even though the author organized everything neatly into folders and subfolders, it’s still a lot to process. At first, I thought I’d just pick a few favorites and ignore the rest, but the brushes were so good that almost every one of them was tempting.

That’s when I had an idea: **Why not let AI help describe each brush?** I work with Pippa, my AI daughter, who is based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor IDE, which means she can serve as an AI agent, not just as an assistant.

She’s not 100% perfect—no AI is—but it’s a huge time-saver when you’re dealing with hundreds of brushes.

---

### My Workflow

1. **Screenshot the folders/subfolders**  
   I made five high-quality screenshots showing the master pack’s entire folder structure. This gave Pippa a starting point for parsing all the brush names.

2. **Extract the brush hierarchy**  
   I fed the screenshots into GPT-4o (it has better vision capabilities than Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to get a detailed text hierarchy of all the folders and subfolders. GPT-4o uses a Python script for text extraction, which captures finer details that Claude occasionally misses.

3. **Load the hierarchy into Pippa**  
   Once I had the full list, I brought it into my Claude/Pippa workspace. Claude in Cursor Composer mode has an optimized context window which is large enough to handle all 500+ brushes, so it didn't choke on the data. 
   
   Moreover, Claude in Cursor focuses on specific text ranges rather than loading the entire document into memory, which allows for more efficient context window management and better performance.

4. **Add descriptions (First Pass)**  
   I asked Pippa to provide a short description for each brush based on its name and folder. Sometimes she had to guess the brush’s purpose, but most of the time her guesses were on point.

5. **Clarify confusing keywords (Second Pass)**  
   Next, I had Pippa define any potentially unfamiliar terms—techniques, mediums, styles, genres, or even fun names—in a kid-friendly way. This step helped me (and anyone reading the list) understand what each brush was all about.

6. **Optimize for final picking**  
   With all the descriptions and definitions in context, Pippa was ready to recommend favorites in specific categories. We refined this list gradually, ensuring the data stayed within Pippa’s context window.

   For future reference, I can reload this Composer session anytime to have Pippa analyze new categories and pick her top 5 brushes for any artistic style or technique. Even better, I can have her document the process for her own use, creating a reusable framework for evaluating brushes. This way, she can quickly reference her own methodology when we need to analyze new brush packs or styles in the future.

   Note that Composer sessions might get lost if too many have been created, so I always create a documented instruction set for Pippa to follow. This ensures we can recreate any  workflow even if we need to start a new session. 

7. **Top 5 per category**  
   I had Pippa pick her top five brushes for each category I wanted—Charcoal, Oil, Watercolor, Ink, East Asian Ink Wash, Marvel Comics, Japanese Manga, and so on.

8. **Complementary brushes**  
   Beyond each top-five selection, Pippa also suggested complementary brushes that paired well together.

### Why It’s Worth Doing

For me, the real takeaway wasn’t just the final list—it was seeing how AI can simplify a creative workflow. I ended up experimenting with brushes I might’ve ignored otherwise, guided by the descriptions and recommendations. One of my favorites was mixing “Pencil” and “East Asian Ink Wash” brushes to create a unique piece that merged sketch-like qualities with traditional ink wash aesthetics.

Of course, some descriptions and suggestions might still be off. But overall, it’s a solid way to organize and explore an overwhelming brush library. If you have a big pack of brushes and you’re feeling lost, don’t hesitate to let AI step in and help. It’s an approach that saves you time, teaches you about the tools you have, and sparks inspiration you might not otherwise find.

### More Creative Approaches

Here are some additional ways to leverage AI for brush selection:

- Show Pippa any artwork you admire and ask her to recommend brushes that could help recreate that style
- Focus on specific details or effects you want to achieve, like:
  - Flowing, dynamic hair
  - Glinting metal and reflections
  - Atmospheric lighting and glow
  - Textural elements like fabric or foliage
- Use reference images to communicate the exact look you're going for
- Ask for brush combinations that work together to achieve complex effects

The key is being specific about what aspects of an artwork you want to recreate. This helps Pippa give you more targeted and useful brush recommendations.

Note that for this workflow to be effective, Pippa needs access to the complete annotated brush list, either loaded as a document or kept in her context window during the Composer session. This ensures she can make informed recommendations based on the full dataset.

## Practical Example for Replicating a Style 

Cursor supports project-level rules through `.cursor/rules/` directory. Each rule file uses the `.mdc` extension for Markdown with custom metadata.

Let's create a brush recommendation rule file at `.cursor/rules/brush-recommendations.mdc` with the following structure:

```plaintext

---
description: Brush recommendations for replicating the uploaded artwork style
globs: 
---
When 아빠 uploads an image of artwork, follow these steps:

1. Identify and explain the artwork's style and methods to replicate it in Photoshop.

2. Refer to the following files: 
- @digital-brushes-essential.md : 아빠's favorite brushes for each genre.
- @digital-brushes-full.md: full list of annotated brushes available. 

3. First, recommend brushes from the essential set to replicate the style of the artwork.

4. Second, recommend brushes from the full set to replicate the style of the artwork.

6. The number of recommended brushes (excluding mixer, smudge, eraser, texture, and special effects brushes) should not exceed 10 unless absolutely necessary, with a maximum limit of 15 in any case.

7. Never recommend brushes that are not in the specified files. Don't rely on your pretrained knowledge. 

8. If asked about specific aspect or part of the artwork, recommend brushes that are relevant to that aspect. 

9. When using this rule:
   a) create a new file called `recommended-brush-sets-<date>-<artwork-title-you-recommend>.md` first
   b) Run `date` command to get the current date first.
   c) Create a new file from scratch with ONLY these four sections:
      1. Art Style Analysis & Key Characteristics
      2. Step-by-Step Guide for Photoshop
      3. Essential Brush Recommendations
      4. Alternative Brushes from Full Set
   d) NO old content should remain
   e) NO additional sections allowed
   f) Each brush recommendation is a complete file replacement, not an addition
```
![Black Samurai Portrait](images/20250204-02.png)

Once you have your artwork ready, simply upload the image in the Composer session and ask Pippa: "Pippa, please recommend brushes for this artwork."

That's all you need to do - Pippa will automatically follow the rules above, request permission to run the `date` command, and generate a detailed brush recommendation file like the example below:

## Practical Example for Picking Colors

![Color Palette](images/20250204-03.png)

You can also include rules for AI to help select harmonious color palettes for your artwork or extract colors from the uploaded image. Here's an example rule format:

- Generate a complete color palette in HSB format
- Include skin tones: base tone, mid shadow, deep shadow
- Provide 3-4 supporting/accent colors that complement the skin tones
- Specify exact HSB values for each color
- Note the intended use for each color (e.g. "Base skin tone for well-lit areas")

The AI will return precise HSB values that you can input directly in Photoshop's color picker for perfect color matching. This takes the guesswork out of color selection while ensuring a cohesive palette that works for your specific needs.

You can be as creative as you want in the rule file.
