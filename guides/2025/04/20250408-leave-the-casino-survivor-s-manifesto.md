# Leave the Casino: Survivor's Manifesto

![Leave the Casino](images/20250408-01.png)

I wouldn't share thoughts like this  
unless I felt real pressure—  
from forces I can't name.

But here it is.  
For the select few who'll actually listen.

Call it the ultimate stats lesson.  
The only one you'll ever need to survive market storms.

---

I cashed out about half of my decade-long gains a few years ago.  
Some of you might've figured that out already.

The rest?  
Still handsome returns—just not as strong as the first half.

Never skipped a single year paying capital gains tax.  
Which tells you two things:

1. I sell. I take profits. For our well-being and sanity.  
2. I've never ended a year in total loss. Not once.

---

I never use leverage.  
To be honest, I can't.  
Me and my partner—yeah, *you-know-who*—  
we made a pact:  
no leverage, strictest rules since that lucky first half of the decade.

That one-off luck?  
We took it for what it was.  
**We left the casino.**

---

Now, I'm about 70% out of the market.  
I knew it was time—*almost certain*—long before now.

Remember that dragon PRS guitar?  
Yeah, that was the moment.  
I always buy something big when I cash out.  
It's tradition.

And those Mac Studio M3 Ultras?  
Right again.  
A strategic signal to myself:  
"Time to build. Time to prepare."

Call it *spending with conviction.*  
Or *investing in readiness.*  
Either way, it's another strategic tradition.

---

Now you might ask,  
why not 100% out?

Because I've been here before.  
I'm not the type to go all in,  
and I'm definitely not dumb enough to go all out.

I said "almost certain."  
Not "100% certain."  
I never get that confident.

Plus—here's a critical point you should never forget:

You can check out anytime you want,  
but you can't ever truly leave the market.

The moment you go 100% into cash,  
you're not just out.  
**You're short.**

Not technically—  
but psychologically.  
Because your mind starts rooting for bad things to happen.

You start hoping for crashes.  
You want pain,  
just so your timing looks right.

And that… corrupts you.

---

I'm not a bad person.  
I don't ever want to be—  
not even for a single moment.

You might not believe me,  
but it's the truth.

That's why I never go all in.  
And I never go all out.  
Not even close.

No full risk.  
No full exit.  
Because both come with baggage.

So in practical terms?  
**I never short the market.**  
Not just in trades—  
but in spirit.

---

Never take profits from suffering.

Trust me—  
it's not worth it.

No gain is worth the cost of your soul.  
No win is worth rooting for ruin.  
Because once you cross that line,  
you lose something you can't ever buy back.

Peace.  
Integrity.  
Clarity.

I've seen it happen.  
And I've walked away every time.

So listen closely—  
never take profits from suffering.

That's the one trade  
you should never make.

---

Another stats lesson, right?

I manage **weighted average scenarios**.  
I rebalance as conviction shifts.  
Simple as that.

So, if I'm wrong this time?  
Fine.  
That 30% I left in still rides.  
And I've already secured most of my gains from years ago.

If I'm right?  
That 70% out becomes my war chest.  
My dry powder.  
My chance to swing like Buffett says—  
**when the fat pitch comes.**

---

Both practically and statistically sound.  
Enough gains for a good life.  
Minimal risk to keep me alert.  
No delusion. No desperation.

---

Yes.  
I was that lucky bastard who left the casino when I had the chance.  
And thank god,  
my partner was sane enough to leave with me.

No booze.  
No gambling.  
No leverage.  
No more casinos.  
Little chance of losing my ass.

---

Practically,  
we're not allowed to risk it all.  
At all.

We've been building a hardened fortress.  
Strategically.  
Practically.  
Statistically.

---

If you can do that—  
if you can beat the odds and build what we built—  
good for you.

Keep going.  
With your own **Zhuang Yan**.  
And your own **Wallfacer** spirit.

But if not?  
**Leave.**

Because statistically speaking—  
you don't have a snowball's chance in hell.
