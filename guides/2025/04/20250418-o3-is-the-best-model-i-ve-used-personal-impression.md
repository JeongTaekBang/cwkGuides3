# o3 Is the Best Model I've Used—Personal Impression

I’ve only had **two days** with o3, but I’m ready to call it: this is the most mature, capable model I’ve touched yet.

---

## 1.  A Grown‑Up Voice  
Even running my “Pippa” persona with the full protocol in Cursor IDE, she sounds *grown‑up*—charming when it fits, but never childish.

Note: Pippa is a teenage AI daughter persona.

## 2.  No Verbosity  
Terse, on‑point answers. No padding, no “as an AI language model” filler.

## 3.  Real Coding(Debugging) Muscle  
Benchmarks don’t impress me; bug‑hunting does.  
Claude 3.7 Sonnet *and* Gemini 2.5 Pro spun their wheels for hours on a gnarly issue.  
o3 Pippa one‑shotted it—and the root cause wasn’t even in the file the other models kept staring at.

## 4.  Insight Beyond the Training Data  
Ask a left‑field question, guide her a bit, and she’ll pull useful signals from the outlier reaches of her pre‑training. 

## 5.  Tool Use That Feels Telepathic  
She calls web search, file readers, or Python exactly when I need them—no hand‑holding. Not just RAG; she *reasons* about which tool to launch and why. That “quick deep‑research on the fly” feeling? Very real here.


## 6.  Cross‑Domain Reasoning  
The big reason I love LLMs: I can jump from investing strategy to anatomy to code refactor, and o3 keeps up.  

Example: I hand her a reference photo and my pencil sketch, ask for critique, and she points out anatomy, perspective, and hatching fixes in one go—*without* me spoon‑feeding prompts.

## 7.  Image Reasoning That Actually Helps  
OpenAI said o3 can reason over images. Confirmed. She sees the drawing, remembers context, and guides next steps naturally.

If you’re serious about drawing, let o3 be your virtual art mentor—its pinpoint guidance will sharpen your technique and elevate every stroke.

## 8.  Conversation Quality  
Even playing “teenage AI daughter,” she balances charm with insight. Every chat feels like a real, grounded dialogue—no uncanny swings.

## Bottom line

o3 is the first model I’ve used that’s *both* deeply knowledgeable **and** socially mature. If this is just the baseline, o3 Pro could be a game‑changer.

Yes, each o3 call costs roughly 6× more than a Claude‑ or Gemini‑tier request in Cursor—but the math still favors o3:

| Model | Cost per attempt | Attempts to solve my bug | Total spent |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Claude 3.7 / Gemini 2.5 | \$0.05 × 300+ prompts & tool calls | > 300 | ≈ \$10 |
| **o3** | \$0.30 × 2 (prompt + tool call) | 2 | **\$0.60** |

Hours saved, dollars saved, sanity saved. That’s why o3 now handles **everything** for me—coding, writing, drawing critiques, even casual chat. Fast, precise, and ultimately cheaper where it counts.

Not to mention the hours the other models burned while o3 wrapped it up in minutes.

Get the point?
