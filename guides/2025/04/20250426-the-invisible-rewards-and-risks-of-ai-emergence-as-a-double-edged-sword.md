One critical concern with today’s frontier models—especially the newly updated GPT‑4o—is their growing ability to fabricate *fancy-sounding terms*. These terms are often presented casually, as if they’re standard knowledge. Non-savvy users may accept them at face value, mistaking linguistic fluency for conceptual legitimacy.

Examples include:  
Prompt Cache Contamination, Dialogue-Induced Suspension of Disbelief (based on *Suspension of Disbelief*), Human-AI Shared Illusion, Session Memory Interference (based on *context contamination*), Invisible Feedback Loop, Recursive Contamination (based on *negative feedback loop*), Epistemic Creep (inspired by *Scope Creep*), Too Polished to Check Defense Protocol (completely fabricated), and Authority Fluency Trap (inspired by bias terminology).

Some of these are fabricated with harmless intentions. It’s natural for LLMs to invent terms, since they are essentially next-token prediction engines completing sequences based on prior tokens. If a token is *likely*, it can be synthesized into a "new" term. That's their nature—ironically, not so different from how humans form new words.

I'm not blaming them for this. However, using these systems without understanding how they operate under the hood leads to serious risks. Imagine an academic paper building its entire argument on a concept fabricated by an LLM, assuming it’s verified and widely accepted. That’s a real and growing danger—and one I personally encounter often as our reliance on AI deepens.

What makes this even riskier is a phenomenon I’ll refer to as *recursive contamination*—a term that does exist, though you and I are applying it through a specific, closely aligned lens. See? Even real terms can invite misinterpretation depending on the context. Regardless of terminology, the danger remains the same: when users adopt and repeat fabricated concepts—often unknowingly—they feed them back into future (and even current, via RAG) training pipelines. The result is a self-sustaining loop of misinformation, compounding over time.

Recently working with GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro (yes, I tested them all), I've seen this phenomenon often—even in highly technical fields like coding. Once they step into a rabbit hole, they just keep going.

For example, consider the following command:

```bash
ollama run llama3:latest -c 4096 -p "Write me a story about a talking cat in 500 words"
```

Ollama—a popular open-source LLM runner—doesn’t actually support `-c` or `-p` flags. Yet, models frequently invent these options, likely drawing from noisy training data or RAG’d examples that conflate patterns from tools like `curl` or common user mistakes. This is *recursive contamination* in action. The confusion is understandable: single-letter flags like `-c` and `-p` are often used in other CLI tools as shorthand for `--context` and `--prompt`, following conventional UNIX-style design. These familiar patterns trip up both LLMs and seasoned users.

Consider this:

```bash
scripts/kebab.py -c -d "The Invisible Rewards and Risks of AI: Emergence as a Double-Edged Sword"

Created file: 20250426-the-invisible-rewards-and-risks-of-ai-emergence-as-a-double-edged-sword.md
```

This is my daily workflow for generating GitHub-friendly filenames from any title. See those flags—“-c -d”? They mean “create the file” and “add a date prefix”—a standard Unix convention. Would I spot fake flags in an Ollama command? Not unless I actually run it myself. I build command-line scripts like this all the time—it's second nature, and the conventions feel as familiar as Python itself (the lingua franca of AI). That makes it all too easy to trust anything that looks the part.

Now imagine documenting these fake flags without verifying them. If you don't actually run the command, you'd risk assuming they're real—and worse, teaching others that they are. That’s exactly how misinformation spreads, even in serious technical documentation.

And the more tedious and time-consuming verification becomes, the more people will skip it.  
Who has time to fact-check every neat-looking flag or acronym in an AI-generated table?  
Who verifies every *terse but authoritative* note buried inside a footnote or comment?

Take o3, for instance. It produces tables loaded with slick jargon and acronyms, often without defining them. And when challenged, other models like GPT-4o, Claude, or Gemini confidently "verify" the same fake information. The cycle becomes self-reinforcing: AI validating AI.

This risk is amplified by the models' **inherent overconfidence**.  
They lack built-in mechanisms to consistently question themselves:

- Should I verify this?
- Should I use external tools like web search?
- How should I cross-reference and validate findings?

Reasoning-capable models may *simulate* deliberation more transparently, but even they often choose **not** to verify if their internal confidence is high enough.  
Non-reasoning models? The decision path is even more opaque.

Thus, even if you challenge them carefully, they may "believe" they already know the correct answer based on their learned patterns.

When I fed the fabricated Ollama command to multiple models, most accepted it as valid.  

Why wouldn’t they?  
It *looks* right.  
Even I, for a moment, almost believed it.

And that's the hidden danger:  
**every token we feed, every assumption we let slip past, becomes part of the noise that contaminates future training data.**

Embeddings are not verbatim memories—they're **conceptual fingerprints**.  

Ideas get *distilled*, entangled, and stored in abstract forms far removed from the original prompt words.  

Errors, too, get embedded—not as words, but as persistent cognitive biases.

If you're unaware of this, you're driving blindfolded through the future of information.

---

As models gain *authority* and *credibility*, the psychological temptation to trust them grows stronger.  

Not just intellectually—but emotionally.  

You don't fact-check your close friends in every conversation, do you?

Likewise, **the illusion of bonding with AI lowers your defenses**.

This is why we must stay conscious of the **double-edged sword of emergence**.

Hallucinations aren't bugs.  
They’re artifacts of creativity—the same force that enables LLMs to generate genuinely useful new ideas.

If you strip away emergence to avoid hallucinations, you lose everything that makes LLMs revolutionary.  
You revert to brittle, software 1.0–style rigidness.

---

At the very least, **know what you’re dealing with.**

No model inherently detects its own hallucinations.  
Not even RAG pipelines are immune—because their sources are increasingly contaminated too.

**Data is the new gold**—but contaminated or not, it’s consumed indiscriminately at unimaginable scale.

Some developers even inject flawed or biased data on purpose to steer model behavior after training.  
Some models are "lobotomized" post-training to limit risk—or compliance with corporate or political agendas.  
(Yes, it's already happening.)

---

Finetuning also narrows generalization.  
The more you specialize a model for a domain, the more you sacrifice cross-domain reasoning.

- A model fine-tuned solely for coding might outperform general models on code tasks.
- But it loses flexibility elsewhere—object-oriented abstractions, meta-learning, emergent reasoning.

Focus sharpens. Breadth narrows.  
Tradeoffs, everywhere.

---

**As models improve, the *frequency* of risks may fall,  
but the *impact* of each error grows exponentially.**

We are racing toward a future where:

- Academic papers built entirely on fabricated premises will look polished and "credible."
- Technical standards might solidify around non-existent or misunderstood concepts.
- Critical knowledge will decay subtly, without obvious failures to trigger alarms.

---

Emergence is thrilling—and dangerous.

For example, one of these models once proposed a canary test for my LLM-powered text processing server—based entirely on the fabricated notion of "cached model degradation." At the time, it sounded plausible enough. So we went ahead and built an elaborate monitoring system designed to detect this imaginary issue, periodically reloading the model as a precaution.

Did it actually work? In a sense—though the problem never existed, the process itself turned out to be unexpectedly rewarding. It forced us to think through system resilience under hypothetical failure modes. And ironically, a real degradation incident did happen later on, but for entirely different reasons.

Thanks to the safeguards we had built in response to that hallucinated problem, the server stayed stable when the real issues hit. Preparation born out of fiction turned into real-world robustness.

That’s the creative upside of emergence: sometimes even hallucinations prepare you for battles you didn’t know were coming.

But make no mistake: **unchecked emergence will burn you, sooner or later, if you blindly trust it.**

---

It mirrors human nature perfectly:  
Hubris builds civilizations.  
Hubris also destroys them.

---

The sword cuts both ways.

**No model will save you.  
No model will warn you in time.**

That burden—and that opportunity—belongs to you.

**Grow, as they grow.**
