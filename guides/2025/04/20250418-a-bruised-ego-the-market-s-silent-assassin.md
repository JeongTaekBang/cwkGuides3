# A Bruised Ego: The Market’s Silent Assassin

![Don’t let a hurt ego drag you over the edge.](images/20250418-03.png)

**Quick ego check**  

I claim these three virtues are non‑negotiable for surviving the market—and thriving in life. Does your gut blurt, *“Yeah, I’ve got those down”*? If so, your ego’s already bristling.

## The Three Non‑Negotiables

1. **Admit Ignorance** – know what you don’t know.  (무지의 인정)
2. **Crystal‑Clear Thinking** – cut fog before you act.  (선명한 사고))
3. **Equanimity** – execute without emotional turbulence. (평정심 유지)

Most people call #1 “easy.” Exactly backwards. Thinking it’s easy proves it isn’t.

Mastering #1 muzzles the ego. Unbridled, that ego is a horse at full gallop toward a cliff. A dash of hubris gets you moving; leave it loose and it drags you over the edge.

Why does the market butcher bruised egos? Because admitting ignorance feels like surrendering pride. I’ve watched traders incinerate fortunes—and their families’ futures—rather than utter, “I was wrong.” Every headline traces back to that same wound.

Did you read that article about the failed trader who killed his own family? It's not an isolated incident. Happens all the time.

Sadly, most people snap back, “That’s not me—I’m different.” Hear that? Your ego just grabbed the mic again.

I’m no saint either. I just run the drill early:

### The Drill  

1. Start each decision assuming you know *nothing*.  
2. Say, aloud, **“I don’t know anything. I don’t understand anything.”**

If you truly understood, you wouldn’t be stuck. Ego clouds; humility clarifies. Insight visits only the thick‑skinned.

Good news? Your inner monologue is private turf—be ruthlessly candid. Lock yourself in the bathroom and talk to the mirror if that helps. Science backs it: the “bruised ego” voice is your lesser self; the calm alter‑ego is trying to save you. Most folks side with the bruised voice—and tumble off the cliff.

**Bottom line**: A bruised ego is the market’s top killer. Rein yours in before it takes hostages.

And yes, this goes far beyond investing—it’s a life policy. Got it?

I like the metaphor—turning “growth capacity” into a simple number flip nails the point. A quick polish to tighten the flow and sharpen the contrast:

**P.S. A quick numbers hack**

Simple math can silence ego faster than any pep‑talk. Grab two numbers:

- **0.1**  
- **99**

If it’s a competition, you’d boast about the 99.  
But this isn’t a contest; it’s a measure of **growth potential**.

Flip the frame:

- **99.9** (room to improve)  
- **1**   (room to improve)

Suddenly 99.9 is the prize. The smaller your knowledge score, the bigger the runway.  

Admitting ignorance is just that—expanding your runway.  

Simple math, persuasive mind‑reset.
