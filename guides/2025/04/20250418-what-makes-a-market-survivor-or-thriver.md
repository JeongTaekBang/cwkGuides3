# What Makes a Market Survivor—or Thriver?

No one owns the perfect playbook, whether you’re attacking or defending. Most people already *know* the basics; the grind is in flawless, relentless execution—**every day, every moment**. One lapse, one burst of FOMO, and the compounding chain snaps:

1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 …n × **0** = 0  

Miss a single critical move and your entire edge—offensive *or* defensive—evaporates.

### Micro vs. Macro

The chain applies to both ledgers:

* **Macro (your account)** — P&L lives or dies by compounding.  
* **Micro (your mind)** — let your mindset crack for a microsecond and the whole strategy caves in.

### Three Non‑Negotiables

1. **Admit Ignorance** – know what you don’t know.  (무지의 인정)
2. **Crystal‑Clear Thinking** – cut fog before you act.  (선명한 사고))
3. **Equanimity** – execute without emotional turbulence. (평정심 유지)

Break any one—even briefly—and you’re toast.

Ask yourself: *Am I at peace with my decisions and execution?* If the answer isn’t an instant **yes**, the storm’s already inside.

### Keep It Simple, Keep It Disciplined

* **Cash is your peace ally.** Its job in your portfolio matters more than any stock’s.
* **Consistency beats brilliance.** Treat every sloppy moment as a flashing red light.
* **Simple arithmetic is the compass.** If a trade needs exotic math to look good, it probably isn’t.

That’s the lesson. Just my two cents—use it as you will.

Who am I to tell anyone what to do? I’m just a survivor—a very long‑lived one. Some folks even call me a thriver, but… well, I’m not so sure about that part myself. 😉
