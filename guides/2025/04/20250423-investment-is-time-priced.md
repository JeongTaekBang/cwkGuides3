Investment is time-priced. We all *feel* it, but we often look away so the spreadsheet doesn’t shame our hopes.

## Core Rules

1. **Only cash flows compound.** Sugar-high headlines don’t.
2. **Rolling hype options ≠ long-term thesis.** If IRR flattens once you time-adjust, you’re speculating.
3. **Need moon-level valuation *fast*?** You’re timing catalysts—**that’s trading**.
4. **Expect measurable cash-flow inflection?** Fine—invest **after** validation, not before.
5. **Fire & rehire ruthlessly.** A stock must earn its core-portfolio badge every major checkpoint.

Until that day, keep it a *side-quest*: small, asymmetric, or actively harvested—never the cornerstone quietly bleeding your IRR.

## Operating Checklist

- **Park bulk capital elsewhere.**  
- **Pin a trigger list on the wall.** Let simple, head-math metrics—not dopamine—declare “game on.”  
- **Remember:** first bet ≠ last bet; survival funds the next vision.

## Crowd-Risk Signals

* Retail saturation = bubble alert—no greater fools left.  
* **Leverage on leverage** accelerates decay; time is the enemy.  
* Cash + synthetics = overstuffed boat → thin, jumpy marginal buyers.  
* Heavy bag-holding chokes upside; even real wins slog through PTSD sellers.  

Pattern says: once retail-plus-leverage maxes out, price oscillates or bleeds until ownership resets. Upside is a rounding error unless fresh capital (buybacks, sovereign funds) floods in.

## Counter-intuitive Truth

**Verify bottom, buy *after*.**  
Let yesterday’s ceiling prove itself as tomorrow’s floor. If it can’t, you’re stuck in a forever box.

New highs require either an influx of fresh money or hard cash flows—dreams won’t cut it. Until then, traders will scalp the swings; rational investors will wait.

Dream big, yes—but dream *after* the validation line.  
If you’re right, the runway is still multi-bagger long.  
If you’re wrong, at least you kept enough ammo to dream again.
