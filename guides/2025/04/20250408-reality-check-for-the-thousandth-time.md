# Reality Check - For the Thousandth Time

Another simple stats lesson you choose to ignore.

Let me ask you something—  
can you beat Warren Buffett?  
Over the long run?

Be honest.

If your answer is "yes,"  
you're either delusional—  
or you wouldn't be here reading this.

So let's assume you bit your ego and said "no."

Good.  
Now let's get real.

Say you outperformed Buffett for a few months or even years.  
Nice.  
Now what?

Here's your hint:  
**Statistics.**

I've rehashed this arithmetic truth too many times.  
But it bears repeating:

What happens to your returns over time?

Yep—**mean reversion.**  
Your flashy gains fade,  
and you drop below Buffett's CAGR.

Hard pill to swallow?

It should be.  
Because you'll likely give back most of what you've been bragging about.

Stats.  
Simple as that.

5% long-term winners?  
Try 0.1%.  
And that's being generous.

So what should a lucky bastard with beginner's luck and better returns than Buffett do?

Simple:  
**Consider it a one-off—and get the hell out.**  
That's the *only* way to beat him.

But who are we kidding, right?  
They'll stay.  
They always do.  

And they'll revert—  
right into the mean of the 99.9% losers.

Again:  
**Stats.**  
Simple as that.
