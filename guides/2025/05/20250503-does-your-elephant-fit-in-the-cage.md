# 🐘 Does Your Elephant Fit in the Cage?

Here's a brutal truth dressed in simple head-math:
**Most investors ask for outcomes that *physically can't fit* inside the range of reality.**

Let me break it down.

## Step 1 · Frame the Premises

* **Premise 1:** Markets trend upward—yes, long-term.
* **Premise 2:** You're a vision-driven investor who admits you *can't time the market*.

Okay. Then let's be honest.

* Your *required return* must exceed the total risk you're carrying:
  **market risk + non-systematic (stock-specific) risk.**
* Aiming for double-digit annual returns means you *must* leave enough headroom to survive drawdowns.

Here's the empirical catch:
**The market rarely cuts your investment in half overnight**, but your tolerance *will*.
That means your returns need to be the size of an elephant, not a mouse.
And the cage? It's barely dog-sized.

## Step 2 · The Geometry of Failure

Think of it like this:
Your required upside = the **elephant**.
The asset's projected trading range over your horizon = the **cage**.

Will your elephant fit?

Take five "hot" stocks and backtest them over the past 10 years.
Then check if your elephant (say, 100% upside in 5 years) ever reliably fits inside the asset's trading range.
Spoiler: **you'll find only a narrow sliver of entry points—if any.**

## Step 3 · The Inverted Entry Insight

Here's the unintuitive part:

> Those rare, viable entries *usually appear at higher prices*, not lower ones.

Why?
Because **breakouts = bigger cages**.
You're not buying high—you're buying a bigger box for your elephant.

Bottom-fishing sounds smart, but your elephant doesn't shrink.
**With age comes lower risk tolerance, not higher.**
That makes your elephant even *less* cage-compatible over time.

## Step 4 · The Graveyard Truth

Most investors don't get blown up by bad picks.
They get annihilated by **sizing elephants for hamster cages.**
They mistake hope for probability.

Your long-term required return doesn't change.
The market's available range rarely expands to meet it.
That's the asymmetry that buries portfolios.

---

**In short: your elephant is bigger than the cage 99% of the time.**
That's not pessimism. That's geometry.

📉 Look at the odds.
📐 Then act accordingly.

No amount of optimism rewrites the interface. Ever.
