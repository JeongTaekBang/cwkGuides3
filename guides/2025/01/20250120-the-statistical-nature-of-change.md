# The Statistical Nature of Change

Let’s face it.

You might find yourself asking, “What the hell is this world coming to? How can they already be so forgetful?” 

But history reveals a simple truth: good things take time—usually longer than we’d hope. Embrace this reality for your own peace of mind. Even small, lasting changes can span generations, while major shifts might happen only once in a lifetime. That’s precisely what moving averages show us.

Just consider yourself. How many New Year’s resolutions have you kept, and for how long? I like to call it “the rule of three.” It takes about three days to start a new habit; three weeks (or roughly 21 days) for it to stick a bit longer (hence all those “21-day diet/fitness” programs). But if you want to see real results, you need at least three months. For a lasting change? About three years. And you can still fall back into your old ways. Even three decades of sobriety doesn’t guarantee an alcohol-free life forever. Get the point?

And you’re expecting every damn individual in your country or this world to stick to their New Year’s resolutions for years—or decades, or even centuries—if you’re hoping for revolutionary changes in a short period of time?

Countless “revolutionary” moments eventually revert to normalcy—that’s just how the world works. So, don’t stress over the short term. One thing is certain: over time, life does improve. Most people naturally strive for better lives. Just keep it real.

Avoid a narrow perspective. Statistics encompass everything—individuals, groups, and societies. Recognize the patterns that apply universally. They’re “universal” for a reason.

I understand—it goes against your intuitive logic or rationality. But c’est la vie.

If you’re still shaking your head over this, you’re living proof of reverting back to normalcy. It’ll take time for you to realize what this is all about. Don’t rely on uneducated or uninformed logic. As I always emphasize: learn and embrace statistics—you’ll thank yourself later.

Did I mention it’d take a good while for you to change? Yeah, you probably won’t even consider picking up a stats book, no matter how many times I tell you to. And if you do, there’s a good chance you’ll toss it aside after a few days. Right? Yet somehow, you still expect the world to change overnight. Figures.

In essence? Good things take *fucking* time. Get used to it.
