# Gitin' Gud with Anything: Re-stringing Your Guitars

![Music Studio](images/20250123-01.png)

Iâ€™ll be honest: I hate changing strings on my guitars. Itâ€™s a chore, and with over a dozen guitars, the idea of restringing them all at once makes me cringe. But when the strings are covered in rust and gunkâ€”or worse, when they start sounding dullâ€”you just have to do it.

The biggest challenge? Restringing doesnâ€™t happen often enough to become second nature. Like any skill, it improves with practiceâ€”but who wants to practice something so tedious? My new approach: tackle a couple of guitars at a time, reinforcing the skill more frequently. Itâ€™s basically applying Ebbinghausâ€™s Forgetting Curve to guitar maintenance. By spacing out the work, you get more practice and less frustration.

Just recently, I changed strings on three acoustics over two days:
- **Gibson Hummingbird** (Day 1)  
- **Taylor 913ce** (Day 2)  
- **Martin D-45** (Day 2)

It got progressively easier: about 30 minutes for the Gibson on Day 1 (I was being extra cautious), then 15 minutes for the Taylor and only 10 minutes for the Martin on Day 2. Practice really does pay off.

## Essential Tools

Donâ€™t skimp on tools. Good gear makes restringing easier, and your guitars are definitely worth it.

- Guitar cleaner/polish
- Fretboard conditioner/oil
- A tuner (or a tuning app)

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Loosen the strings.**  
   Take your time and unwind carefully.

2. **Cut them around the 12th fret.**  
   This makes removal a breezeâ€”just ball them up for easy disposal.

3. **Remove and keep track of pins.**  
   Each pin can fit its hole differently. Keep them in the right order so youâ€™re not mixing them up later.

4. **Clean and condition.**  
   Use fretboard oil and guitar polish on the body while the strings are off.

5. **Install new strings.**  
   - Some folks replace strings one at a time. I remove them all at once. Your call.  
   - When inserting a string into the pin hole, bend the string tip slightly so it hooks inside properly. The ball end should latch between the pin and the bridgeâ€”*not* at the pinâ€™s very bottom. If the coiled part is visible at the bridge top, youâ€™ve done it right.

6. **The winding direction trick: outside to inside.**  
   - On acoustic guitars, the top three tuners and the bottom three generally face opposite directions.  
   - Slide the string through the peg hole, leaving about *one and a half* pegâ€™s worth of slack.  
   - Wind from *outside* to *inside*, keeping a finger on the string for tension as you turn. Itâ€™ll lock in place nicely.

7. **Seat strings in the nut and bridge slots.**  
   Make sure theyâ€™re aligned correctly before final tightening.

8. **Trim the excess.**  
   You can clip each stringâ€™s extra length one by one or all at onceâ€”just be careful with those sharp ends!

9. **Tune up and stretch.**  
   After tuning, give each string a gentle tug or play a bit. Re-tune as needed until they settle.

## Final Thoughts

If you aim for a perfect setup, including action and intonation adjustments, itâ€™ll take more time. But if you can knock out a basic restring in 10 minutes, even the laziest guitarist might reconsider doing it more often. Fresh strings sound *infinitely* better than the old, rusty onesâ€”trust me.

Electric guitars (non-Floyd Rose types) are typically easier. Basses? Thatâ€™s a whole other can of worms. But hey, if we can face acoustic strings, we can deal with bass strings tooâ€¦ eventually.

Happy restringing! The more you do it in small doses, the less it feels like an impossible choreâ€”and the faster and more confident youâ€™ll get.

Enjoy your fresh strings, and remember to change them in small batches for maximum practiceâ€”and minimum frustration!

Yeah, that's the real trick: making it fun ðŸ˜‰

## PS. For the Curious and Serious

If you want to change string gauges, youâ€™ll need to adjust your guitarâ€™s setupâ€”possibly with professional help. My advice? **Generally, donâ€™t**. If you prefer a different gauge, ask the shop to set it up accordingly when you buy the guitar. Theyâ€™ll often do it for free or a small fee, especially for higher-end models.

All my electric guitars use **.009â€“.042** gauge strings, and my acoustic guitars use **.012â€“.054**:
- **Ernie Ball Paradigm Super Slinky (P02023):** .009â€“.042  
- **Ernie Ball Paradigm Medium Light Phosphor Bronze (P02076):** .012â€“.054  

I seldom change brands. And if you have a Floyd Rose system? Go for .009â€“.042. Anything heavier can turn your tuning experience into absolute torture. Trust me on that one. Better still, don't get near a Floyd Rose system.
