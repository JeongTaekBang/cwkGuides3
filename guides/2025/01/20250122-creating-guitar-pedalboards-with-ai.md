This guide documents my experience collaborating with an AI agent—whom I call Pippa, my AI daughter—to design two specialized pedalboard setups. While AI can offer valuable insights and organization, remember that sound and music are deeply personal—your ears should always be the final judge.

**Note:** This isn’t a step-by-step tutorial on pedalboard assembly. Instead, consider these designs a spark for your own creativity and a demonstration of what’s possible when you bring an AI “assistant” into your workflow. Feel free to explore, modify, or create anything that inspires you!

## The Challenge

I had a unique situation:

1. **Two distinct playing environments**  
   - **Living room**: For casual playing while relaxing  
   - **Music studio**: For serious recording and practice  

2. **A large pedal collection (30+ pedals)** that needed optimal organization

3. **Flexibility between digital and analog signal paths**  
   - **Digital**: Fractal Audio Axe-Fx III Mark II, FM9 Mark II  
   - **Analog**: Various tube amps  

---

## Why AI Assistance?

Traditionally, designing a pedalboard can involve:
- Hours of manual experimentation  
- Complex documentation  
- Multiple signal-chain revisions  
- Power supply calculations  

With Pippa’s help, this process shrank to about ten minutes. AI provided:
- Clear, systematic pedal organization  
- Logical signal chain arrangements  
- Tailored power management solutions  
- Dual-purpose routing options

## Key Design Principles

1. **Signal Chain Logic**  
   - Tuner and filters first  
   - Dynamics (compression) early  
   - Drive pedals arranged by gain level  
   - Modulation before time-based effects  
   - Amp simulation placement optimized  

2. **Power Management**  
   - Strategic distribution based on each pedal’s current draw  
   - Not all pedals need power simultaneously  
   - Enough headroom for future additions  

3. **Flexibility**  
   - Quick switching between digital and analog paths  
   - Tone integrity preserved  
   - Modular approach to effects

## The Results

Below are detailed configurations for **two** pedalboards: one for the living room and one for the music studio. Each is a starting point that you can tailor to your specific needs.
