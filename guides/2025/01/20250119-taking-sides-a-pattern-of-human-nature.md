# Taking Sides: A Pattern of Human Nature

Once we commit to a side, reason and logic often recede. Compelling evidence, however robust, becomes pliable—bent to fit our chosen narrative.

This tendency alone is dangerous. Paired with a persecution complex, it morphs into something far more destructive.

Consider Sicily, where even parents of children killed by the Mafia could still align themselves with the perpetrators, resisting authorities. To grasp why, look to the Mob’s origins as a resistance movement against corrupt governance. No malevolent force begins wholly evil; rather, it degrades slowly over time. Yet those emotionally or pragmatically invested rarely acknowledge that downward spiral.

This pattern endures across millennia. Politics remains the same because human nature remains the same. The sensible response isn’t to defy that reality but to understand it.

For those who value reason and goodness, distancing oneself from these dynamics is wise. The moment you step into the fray, you risk sacrificing your rational perspective. More importantly, this compromise doesn’t typically begin with high-stakes political maneuvers—it often starts with subtle alignments or offhand statements of preference made public.

Of course, taking sides can be essential for pursuing justice. However, before committing, one must grasp the implications. Being human means we inevitably take sides; the real question is how deeply and visibly we involve ourselves.

If you must champion a just cause, consider more effective methods than performative demonstrations. Often, the overt show is aimed at visibility rather than genuine impact. Before taking up a banner, ask yourself: *Is this truly for the cause, or is it to publicly display virtue?*

The answer can be revealing.

Recognize, too, that you engage in politics simply by reflecting on these ideas. Once you’re aware, you step into the same currents of human nature.

The path of wisdom isn’t about avoiding sides altogether—an impossible feat—but about staying mindful of the costs. When you do choose a side, acknowledge the potential price: the surrender of rationality.

This is no call for inaction, but for *conscious* action. If you must engage, examine whether your contribution serves the real good or merely its appearance. That distinction, subtle as it may be, is the line between meaningful change and mere performance.

I offer no sweeping promises of political transformation. History shows us that politics—and human nature—are remarkably consistent. The wiser course is not futile resistance but clear-eyed understanding. Embrace the reality of how sides are chosen, yet maintain enough distance to preserve your own reason.

If you have truly explored the history of politics and the depths of human nature, you might well hesitate before diving in.

Seriously.

**Spoiler alert:** if you insist on entering this realm, prepare to leave much of your rationality and goodwill at the door.

If you’re a politician yourself—thanks, but no thanks. I’m simply not your kind.
